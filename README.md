# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This ~~is~~ was mostly a 'practice' repository, containing some ML algorithms which I have implemented from scratch. 
I no longer update or maintain this.

1. [**K Nearest Neighbours**](K-Nearest-Neighbours): Recommends movies from the TMDB 5000 movies dataset based on the list of genres given as input.
---
2. [**Logistic Regression**](Logistic-Regression): Predicts how likely peope are to buy a product based on their gender, age, and salary.
---
3. [**Simple Neural Network**](Simple-Neural-Network): 2-layered neural network which mimics the XOR gate, implemented(vectorized) from scratch using NumPy.
---
4. [**Digit Classification**](Digit-Classification): Dataset used: MNIST  
    - Contains a binary classifier that labels all 0s as 1 and rest all digits as 0.
    - Also contains an extension of the above classifier that classifies all 10 digits with an accuracy of 94%.
    - Both of the above networks are 2-layered and are implemented(vectorized) from scratch using NumPy.

5. [**Decison Trees**](Decision-Trees): Decision Tree classifier implemented from scratch in python. Dataset used: [Banknote authentication dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication)
---
6. [**Support Vector Machine**](SVM): A simple C-SVM binary classifier. Dataset used: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
---
7. [**K-Means Clustering**](K-Means-Clustering): 
	- Dataset used: [Synthetic 2-d data with N=5000 vectors and k=15 Gaussian clusters with different degree of cluster overlap](http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/)
	- Implemented K-Means clustering algorithm. Used `matplotlib` to visualize clusters and centroids.  
---
8. [**Principal Component Analysis**](PCA):
	- Dataset used: [AT&T Database of Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces)
	- Applied the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm for dimensionality reduction on face images.

9. [**Moving Averages**](Moving-Averages)
   - Dataset used: [Air Quality Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality)
   - Applied Simple Moving Average (SMA), Cumulative Moving Average (CMA), Weighted Moving Average (WMA), Exponentially Weighted Average (EWMA) on the dataset, all functions are written in NumPy.

10. [**Convolutions**](Convolutions)
    - [Edge Detection using kernels in NumPy](Convolutions/Edge-Detection-with-Kernels.ipynb)
    - [Automated Canny Edge Detector](Convolutions/Automated-Canny-Edge-Detector)
  
---
    
11. [**Histogram Equalization**](Histogram-Equalization)
    - Covers the theory behind histogram equalization
