# Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch
   
This is mostly a 'practice' repository, containing some ML algorithms which I have implemented from scratch. Why? because:

> “What I cannot create, I do not understand”  
    ~ *<cite>Richard Feynman</cite>*

I'll keep updating this repo as and when I learn new algorithms and implement it.  
  
1. **K-Nearest-Neighbours**: Recommends movies from the TMDB 5000 movies dataset based on the list of genres given as input.
---
2. **Logistic-Regression**: Predicts how likely peope are to buy a product based on their gender, age, and salary.
---
3. **Simple Neural Network**: 2-layered neural network which mimics the XOR gate, implemented(vectorized) from scratch using NumPy.
---
4. **Digit-Classification**: Dataset used: MNIST  
    - Contains a binary classifier that labels all 0s as 1 and rest all digits as 0.
    - Also contains an extension of the above classifier that classifies all 10 digits with an accuracy of 94%.
    - Both of the above networks are 2-layered and are implemented(vectorized) from scratch using NumPy.

5. **Decison Trees**: Decision Tree classifier implemented from scratch in python. Dataset used: [Banknote authentication dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/banknote+authentication)
---
6. **Support Vector Machine**: A simple C-SVM binary classifier. Dataset used: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)
---
7. **K-Means Clustering**: 
	- Dataset used: [Synthetic 2-d data with N=5000 vectors and k=15 Gaussian clusters with different degree of cluster overlap](http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/datasets/)
	- Implemented K-Means clustering algorithm. Used `matplotlib` to visualize clusters and centroids.  
---
8. **PCA**:
	- Dataset used: [AT&T Database of Faces](https://www.kaggle.com/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces)
	- Applied the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm for dimensionality reduction on face images.
